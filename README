When you often start projects or you often have to try things out, you'll recognize that you 
deal with the same kind of tasks every time. For instance you catch a copy of lithium, catch a copy 
of twitters bootstrap and put them together. You start to write the same kind of routes, models, controllers
again and again.

This aims to be a good starting point for new projects or prototypes that already includes the powerfull
lithium framework and the awesome Twitter Bootstrap layout. On top of that this project is filled with some
usefull li3 libraries and some stuff you'll need most of the time when you start over.
